// A) Write a program in C to merge two different strings with even number of 
// characters in such a way that the resultant string should display the characters of the 
// first string interleaved with the characters of the second string and then create a new 
// string by reversing both halves of the merged string. (use pointers)
// B) Write a ‘C’ program to read element in array and display the sum of the elements 
// in an array.
