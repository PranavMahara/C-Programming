// Write a program in C to find the maximum n – m such that array[n] > array[m] from a given array[]. Go to the editor
// Given an array arr[], find the maximum j – i such that arr[j] > arr[i]
// Expected Output:
// The given array is:
// 7 5 8 2 3 2 4 2 1 0
// m = 0, n = 2, arr1[m] = 7 arr1[n] = 8 difference = 2
// m = 3, n = 6, arr1[m] = 2 arr1[n] = 4 difference = 3
// The maximum differcences between two position of array index is: 3
