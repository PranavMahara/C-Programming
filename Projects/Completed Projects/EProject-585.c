// Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. 
// His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x , that is,  ; 
// such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. 
// Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.


// SAMPLE INPUT 
// 5
// 1 2 3 4 5

// SAMPLE OUTPUT 
// 4

// Initial sum of array = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
// When we update all elements to 4, sum of array = 4+4+4+4+4 = 20 which is greater than 15.
// Note that if we had updated the array elements to 3,  15 which is not greater than 15. So, 4 is the minimum value to which array elements need to be updated.
